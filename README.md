# Wireless_NW_Load_Related_KPIs
This data set contains simulated latency and resource utilization related KPIs for estimating load on cells in a wireless network.

The simulation takes into account the ranges and statistical properties observed from real wireless network data for same set of KPIs. It consist of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are related to latency and resource utilization in cells of a wireless network. 
First and second columns are timestamp and cell names respectively. Third column is for DL PDCP latency GBR and the values are in milliseconds. Fourth column represents DL PDCP latency non-GBR. Here DL PDCP (Down Link Packet Data Convergence Protocol) latency is the mean retention delay for a PDCP SDU (Service Data Unit) inside eNB for GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate) and non-GBR radio bearers. Fifth column indicates the average number of active users during the granularity period of collection. Sixth column indicates percentage of DL PRB (Downlink Physical Radio Bearer) utilization. Seventh column indicates the number of RRC connected UEs during the granularity period. The eighth column is the label generated using expert knowledge. A label of 1 indicates high load, and a label of 0 indicates low load. Here, granularity period is set to 15 minutes. Meaning, these KPIs are collected once every 15 minutes from every cell.
